TITLE: render

ABOUT: Renders an undirected, connected, weighted graph and finds the minimum spanning tree (MST) 
	   using Kruskal's algorithm. The graph edges are represented by dashed lines, the MST is traced
	   in solid lines. Edges are added to MST in greedy fashion, and rendered in that order. 

EXECUTION: ./render

	   
RUNTIME: O(E LOG V)
